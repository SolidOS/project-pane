# project-pane
Projects may have for example

- Chat
- Communal To-Do lists:
- Issue tracker
- Action item tracker
- Meetings
- Tag vocabulary for tagging things.  When you tag,. do it in a way that people in your project share the meaning of the tag.
- Sub-projects!

- Lists of resources they are using or have available -- human readable ones and/or technical resources like ontologies etc

## Vision

Projects maybe at the high end also cover things like Companies and  non-project organizations.  At that end,
maybe like schema:Project (which is too big for this, but would gave say departments)

At the low end, projects can be specific technical projects, like  form-based user-generated apps creation.
Projects could be be at github organizations or also at or repos level.
